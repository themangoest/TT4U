# TT4U
Teletype port to 4U system

After mounting the complete DIY Terminal PCB you can choose to flash the firmware first or after mounting the I/O pcb. 
I rather flash it first and to do so I suggest to mount the USB A connector on the Terminal PCB to be able to flash.
Don't solder the outer ground brackets of the USB conenctor on the Terminal, because this connector has to be mounted on the I/O pcb.

Flashed or not, you will have to mount an army of male pins on the terminal.
